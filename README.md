# weatherV2
 
This is a project to fix a freeware weather engine for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020.

This will be updated as work moves forward, currently working to identify what changes are needed so they can be solutioned.

Instructions on how to use the weather engine will be added once it is in any kind of usable state.
